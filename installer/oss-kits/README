README file for oss-kits

The files in this directory reflect bundle files for each of our open-source
server providers. Note that there are no hard-coded file paths here. Instead,
filenames are determined dynamically.

At the time of this README file creation, this directory contains:

    apache-cimprov-1.0.0-423.universal.1.i686.sh
    apache-cimprov-1.0.0-423.universal.1.x86_64.sh
    apache-oss-test.sh
    mysql-cimprov-1.0.0-186.universal.1.i686.sh
    mysql-cimprov-1.0.0-186.universal.1.x86_64.sh
    mysql-oss-test.sh
    README

The bundle creation software expects the following for each open-source
provider:

    <provider-name>-oss-test.sh
    <provider-name>-cimprov.*.i686.sh    (Only one match allowed)
    <provider-name>-cimprov.*.x86_64.sh  (Only one match allowed)


It is assumed that each bundle will conform to the following:

    1) Will at least create a directory named
           /opt/microsoft/<provider-name>-cimprov.
       This is used for removal of the package during SCX removal,
    2) For purposes of purging, after removal of the kit, the following
       directories will be deleted:
           /etc/opt/microsoft/<provider-name>-cimprov
           /opt/microsoft/<provider-name>-cimprov
           /var/opt/microsoft/<provider-name>-cimprov

If files are created in other locations, the package should remove the files
as part of the uninstall process.


Bundle creation software works as follows:

    For each *-oss-test.sh file,
    a) Include the file itself into the bundle,
    b) Include the associated i686.sh file for i386 builds,
    c) Include the associated x86_64.sh file for x86_64 builds


Bundle installation works as follows:

    For each *-oss-test.sh file,
    a) Run the file.
    b) If it returns 0, that means that the associated bundle file should be
       installed (otherwise, the associated bundle file is NOT installed).


To add a new OSS provider to this directory, do the following:

    1) Create <provider>-oss-test.sh file to determine if bundle should be
       installed,
    2) Check in associated <provider>-cimprov-*.sh binary bundle files
       (built for release and for distribution to customers). Two should
       be checked in, one ending in .i686.sh and another ending in
       .x86_64.sh.
