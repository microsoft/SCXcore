cppunit was built the following way from the cppunit-1.12.0 source.

./configure --disable-dependency-tracking CXXFLAGS="-arch i386 -gdwarf-2 -O2" --prefix=/Users/stefan/cppunit/
make AM_LDFLAGS="-XCClinker -arch -XCClinker i386"
make install

Then the contents of "/Users/stefan/cppunit/" was copied here and pruned somewhat.
The file libcppunit.dylib was a link to libcppunit-1.12.0.0.0.dylib, but since links don't work
very well with TFS it was renamed.
