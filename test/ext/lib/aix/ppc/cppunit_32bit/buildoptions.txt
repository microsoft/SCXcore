cppunit was built the following way from the cppunit-1.12.0 source.

./configure CXX=xlc++_r CXXFLAGS=-q32 --prefix=/suitable/install/dir/
make
make check
make install

Then the contents of "/suitable/install/dir/lib/" was copied here and pruned somewhat.
The file libcppunit.a was a link to libcppunit-1.12.a, but since links don't work
very well with TFS it was renamed.
