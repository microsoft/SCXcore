cppunit was built the following way from the cppunit-1.12.0 source.
Note that we built it without any gnu-tools visible in the path. It was neccessary
to get a linkable libcppunit.a.

./configure CXX=aCC CXXFLAGS="+DD64 -mt -AA -Ag++" --prefix=/suitable/install/dir/
make
make check
make install

Then the contents of "/suitable/install/dir/lib/" was copied here and pruned somewhat.

We had to remove the symlinks because they don't work well with tfs/teamprise.
If you need the dynamic library you should run the restore_links.sh from this dir.
