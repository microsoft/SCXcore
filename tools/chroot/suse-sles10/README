*** Instructions for setting up SCX Ws-Management daemon with chroot
*** 
*************************************************************************************


STEP 1  
Create a directory named "chroot" under /var/opt/microsoft/scx/ on a server with 
SCX Agent already installed.
Copy the chroot scripts (mkjail-wsmand.sh and scx-wsmand.chroot) to this new
directory.
Ensure ownership is root.root and permissions are 744

# cd /var/opt/microsoft/scx
# mkdir chroot
# cd chroot
# cp <ORIGINAL-FILE-LOCATION>/mkjail-wsmand.sh ./
# cp <ORIGINAL-FILE-LOCATION>/scx-wsmand.chroot ./
# chown root.root *
# chmod 744 *


STEP 2
Create the jail

# cd /var/opt/microsoft/scx/chroot
# ./mkjail-wsmand.sh


STEP 3
Stop original services

# service scx-cimd stop
# service scx-wsmand stop


STEP 4
Start CIM Server and new chroot'ed WS-Management service

# service scx-cimd start
# service scx-wsmand.chroot start

*** NOTES
***
*************************************************************************************

* Syslog logging is not supported. Must be investigated further!

* Startup of openwsmand binary does not report status correctly using rc-scripts.
  rc-scripts seems to always return -1 when used together with the chroot binary.
  This has been temporarily solved with a dirty fix.

* Shutdown of openwsmand binary does not work using killproc. 
  This has been solved temporarily with "killall" in current version of the script.

* Only very limited testing has been performed.
